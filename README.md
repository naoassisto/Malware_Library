An effort to create a comprehensive malware library, aimed at cataloging and analyzing a wide range of malware types. The goal is to create a collaborative space where individuals and teams can contribute their findings, enhance the collective understanding of malware, and develop more effective security tools and practices.

## Moral Disclaimer
I am not the author of these codes, i simply am very interested in this subject, so this library will be built as i study the codes and create a simple but informative documentation for each, meaning it will take a while, be patient, if you are looking for just the code, please refer to the sources section and get it straight from the source. I aint no code thief, im simply a student.
