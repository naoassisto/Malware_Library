### **MacOS.Rootkit.Inficere.zip**

- **Category**: MacOS Rootkit
- **Description**: *Inficere* is a sophisticated rootkit targeting MacOS systems. Its primary function is to gain root access, manipulate system processes, and remain hidden from detection tools. Rootkits like *Inficere* are designed to operate at the lowest levels of the operating system, making them difficult to detect and remove. They are often used by attackers to maintain persistence on the system and gain control over the machine.

#### **Functionality**:

1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Gains root or administrative privileges by exploiting vulnerabilities in the MacOS kernel or through social engineering.
   - Grants attackers unrestricted access to the system, allowing them to manipulate or spy on all user activities.

2. **Process and File Hiding**:
   - Uses advanced techniques to hide malicious processes, files, and directories from the user and system monitoring tools.
   - Modifies system-level APIs or hooks into kernel functions to prevent system utilities from displaying any suspicious activity.

3. **Persistence**:
   - Installs itself deep within the MacOS file system, often within critical system directories.
   - Modifies system boot files (e.g., `launchd` or `systemctl`) to ensure it automatically starts with system reboots.

4. **Keylogging & Credential Theft**:
   - Logs keystrokes and captures sensitive data such as passwords, authentication tokens, and other personal information.
   - Sends captured data to a command-and-control (C&C) server controlled by the attacker.

5. **Backdoor Functionality**:
   - Establishes a covert communication channel between the infected Mac and the attacker's server.
   - Allows attackers to send commands, exfiltrate data, install additional malware, or manipulate the system remotely.

6. **Antivirus & Detection Evasion**:
   - Uses rootkit techniques to modify system-level API calls, preventing detection by antivirus software or system integrity checks.
   - Alters system logs or disables logging altogether to obscure traces of the infection.

#### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
1. **File Artifacts**:
   - Suspicious `.zip` files like `Inficere.zip` downloaded from untrusted sources.
   - Presence of unexpected system files or executables in `/System/Library`, `/usr/local/bin`, or `/Library/LaunchDaemons`.

2. **System Instability**:
   - System crashes or kernel panics that may seem random.
   - Unexplained system slowdowns or unusual CPU and memory usage spikes.

3. **Unusual Network Activity**:
   - Persistent or strange outbound connections to unknown IP addresses or domains.
   - Use of encrypted communication channels over uncommon ports.

4. **Hidden Processes**:
   - Certain system processes missing from activity monitoring tools like Activity Monitor or `top`, despite being active.

5. **Boot Changes**:
   - Unusual or unauthorized modifications to `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/sudoers`, or boot-related files.
