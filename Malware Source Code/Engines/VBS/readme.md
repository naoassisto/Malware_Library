- **Category**: VBScript-based Virus

- **Description**: KVPE is a VBScript-based virus that can execute various malicious commands, typically used in botnet or remote access scenarios. VBScript-based malware like this can spread through email attachments, infected websites, or compromised files, often used for AV evasion.

- **Background**: VBScript-based viruses were particularly prevalent in the early 2000s, but they are still found today in targeted attacks. They use the power of Windows Scripting Host (WSH) to run malicious code that interacts with system-level operations, including file manipulation and remote control commands.

- **Functionality**:
  - Executes VBScript commands to perform tasks like file deletion, registry modification, and process manipulation.
  - Can establish persistent backdoors through startup folder or registry entries.
  - Often communicates with command-and-control (C2) servers to receive instructions and exfiltrate data.
  
- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Obfuscated VBScript files (`.vbs` or `.vbe`) found in startup folders or temporary directories.
  - Unknown processes running in the background, potentially related to `wscript.exe`.
  - Network connections to suspicious remote IPs, often related to C2 servers.
