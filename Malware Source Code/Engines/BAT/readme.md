### 1. **Virus.BAT.Poly**

- **Category**: BAT File Virus (Polymorphic)

- **Description**: This is a BAT-based polymorphic virus, which alters its code every time it infects a new system. It primarily targets Windows-based systems through batch files (`.bat`). The polymorphic nature allows the virus to change its appearance while maintaining its core functionality, helping it evade detection by signature-based antivirus programs.

- **Background**: Polymorphic viruses can dynamically change their code but preserve their original behavior. This technique helps them avoid traditional antivirus detection. BAT file viruses, although less common today, are still used in targeted attacks.

- **Functionality**:
  - Infects systems by spreading through batch scripts.
  - Alters its code with each execution, making it difficult to detect using signature-based methods.
  - Can execute commands to delete files, modify system settings, and propagate to other devices on the network.
  
- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Unexpected `.bat` scripts appearing in system folders.
  - Anomalies in system behavior, such as slowdowns or unexpected command prompt activity.
